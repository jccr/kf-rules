Hailed by some as a god, respected by others for your wisdom, you were born—or perhaps created—on the Crucible, a world in which anything is possible.</span></p><p class="p_style1"><span class="style7">The Crucible is ancient, but ever renewed. An artiﬁcial planet hanging in</span><span class="style7"> </span><span class="style5"> the center of the universe, the Crucible’s many layers remain constantly under construction by the enigmatic and mischievous Architects. For raw materials, the Architects have harvested countless worlds, blending them into a new whole both familiar and alien to the creatures that dwell there.</span></p><p class="p_style1"><span class="style8">Whether lone specimens or entire cultures, the beings brought to the</span><span class="style8"> </span><span class="style9"> Crucible ﬁnd themselves in a strange wonderland with no obvious means</span><span class="style9"> </span><span class="style8"> of returning to their former homes. Some thrive, building new societies and developing new technologies with the aid of the mysterious psychic substance known as Æmber. Some discard the trappings of their old lives, adopting the ways and customs of new tribes discovered in this new world. Others devolve, bodies and minds twisted beyond all recognition, incorporating Æmber into their very bodies.</span></p><p class="p_style1"><span class="style5">As an Archon, you have gathered followers in your journeys throughout</span><span class="style5"> </span><span class="style7"> the Crucible, allies who ﬁnd value in your ageless wisdom and your</span><span class="style7"> </span><span class="style5"> ability to speak to all creatures. With the aid of these allies, you seek out Vaults hidden throughout the Crucible by the cryptic Architects. Each Vault can only be unlocked by Æmber-forged keys. Once open, a Vault’s contents—the power and knowledge of the Architects—can be consumed by only a single Archon.</span></p><p class="p_style1"><span class="style5">When two Archons discover a Vault, only one can gain its knowledge. Only one can move one step closer to the secret of the Crucible…</span></p><p class="p_style0"><span class="style10">O</span><span class="style11">VERVIEW</span></p><p class="p_style1"><span class="style5">KeyForge</span><span class="style5"> </span><span class="style3"> is a two-player card game in which each player takes the role of an Archon, and leads that Archon’s deck against their opponent.</span></p><p class="p_style1"><span class="style3">A player’s deck represents a team that is attempting to gain Æmber and</span><span class="style3"> </span><span class="style6"> forge keys. The ﬁrst player to gather three keys is able to unlock a Vault</span><span class="style6"> </span><span class="style3"> and win the game.</span></p><p class="p_style1"><span class="style6">The deﬁning feature of</span><span class="style6"> </span><span class="style5"> KeyForge</span><span class="style5"> </span><span class="style3"> is that no two decks are alike.

To forge a key, the active player spends Æmber from the Æmber pool on their identity card, returning it to the common</span><span class="style3"> </span><span class="style6"> supply.

Chains are used when players want a fair game between two known decks rather than a potentially unfair competition between decks that aren’t known. When playing with new decks, or competing in a tournament, players will not use this handicap.</span></p><p class="p_style1"><span class="style3">When the players have a sense that a particular deck is stronger than the opposing deck, start it with four chains. From then on, every time the chained deck wins three games in a row against that opposing deck, adjust the number of chains up by one, and if it loses three games in a row, adjust the number of chains down by one.</span><span class="style3"> </span><span class="style5"> Â</span></p><p class="p_style1"><span class="style3">As a player plays more games with their collection, the number of</span><span class="style3"> </span><span class="style6"> chains assigned to a deck will ﬂuctuate up and down based on the</span><span class="style6"> </span><span class="style3"> matchup and how well the deck has performed against the opposing deck.</span></p><p class="p_style1"><span class="style3">If players are reasonably familiar with two decks they can ignore the suggested number of chains, and instead bid a number of chains for the right to use a particular deck.</span></p><p class="p_style1"><span class="style235">Example</span><span class="style5">: Terry and Julie decide to play Mother Mahospot against Chancellor Fisher. Mother Mahospot is a deck that both players are very familiar with, feel is quite strong, and enjoy playing. Chancellor Fisher is a newer deck, that the players are not as comfortable playing. The above guidelines suggest they begin with four chains on Mother Mahospot. Julie looks at Fisher, considers a moment, and</span><span class="style5"> </span><span class="style7"> says, “I’ll play Mother Mahospot at ﬁve.” Terry raises to six. Julie</span><span class="style7"> </span><span class="style5"> goes to seven.

(The active player chooses whether this occurs before or after other “Before Fight” effects and keywords.) If this damage destroys the other creature, the rest of the ﬁght does not occur.</span></p><p class="p_style0"><span class="style3">An ability is the special game text a card contributes to the game.</span></p><p class="p_style1"><span class="style3">Unless an ability explicitly references an out-of-play area (such as a hand,</span><span class="style3"> </span><span class="style6"> deck, archives, or discard pile), that ability can only interact with cards</span><span class="style6"> </span><span class="style3"> that are in play.</span></p><p class="p_style34"><span class="style185">ACTION ABILITY</span></p><p class="p_style28"><span class="style185">ATTACK, ATTACKER, ATTACKING</span></p><p class="p_style0"><span class="style3">See “Fight” on page 10.</span></p><p class="p_style1"><span class="style3">To use an “</span><span class="style12">Action:</span><span class="style3">” ability during their turn, the active player must exhaust the card.

Card abilities are the only means by which a player is permitted to add cards to their archives. During step 2 of a player’s turn, after they select an active house, the active player is permitted to pick up all cards in their archives and add those cards to their hand.</span></p><p class="p_style0"><span class="style3">Cards in a player’s archives are considered out of play.</span></p><p class="p_style28"><span class="style185">CAPTURE</span></p><p class="p_style1"><span class="style3">A player may look at their archives at any time. A player is not permitted to look at an opponent’s archives.</span></p><p class="p_style1"><span class="style3">If the ability instructing a player to archive a card does not specify where the card is archived from, the archived card comes from that player’s hand.</span></p><p class="p_style34"><span class="style185">ARMOR</span></p><p class="p_style1"><span class="style3">Some creatures have an armor value to the right of the card title. Armor prevents an amount of damage equal to the armor value that the creature would take each turn.</span><span class="style3"> </span><span class="style4"> Armor prevents damage before it is actually dealt.</span><span class="style4"> </span><span class="style3"> For example, if a creature has two armor and is dealt one damage, that damage is instead</span><span class="style3"> </span><span class="style4"> prevented</span><span class="style4"> </span><span class="style3"> by the armor, leaving the creature with one armor</span><span class="style3"> </span><span class="style4"> that can prevent damage</span><span class="style4"> </span><span class="style3"> left for the rest of the turn. If the creature is later dealt three more damage during that turn, one damage is</span><span class="style3"> </span><span class="style4"> prevented</span><span class="style4"> </span><span class="style3"> and the other two damage are dealt to that creature.</span></p><p class="p_style28"><span class="style185">CHAIN, CHAINS</span></p><p class="p_style1"><span class="style3">Some card abilities cause a player to gain one or more chains. If a player gains chains, that player increases their chain tracker by the number of chains gained.</span></p><p class="p_style1"><span class="style3">If a creature gains armor, the gains are additive and accumulate on top of the creature’s printed armor value.</span></p><p class="p_style1"><span class="style3">If a creature gains armor during a turn, the gained armor does not</span><span class="style3"> </span><span class="style4"> prevent</span><span class="style4"> </span><span class="style3"> damage already dealt that turn. If a creature loses armor during a turn, it is not retroactively dealt damage that was already</span><span class="style3"> </span><span class="style4"> prevented</span><span class="style4"> </span><span class="style3"> by the armor.</span></p><p class="p_style1"><span class="style4">If a creature loses any amount of armor, it loses armor that has been used to prevent damage this turn before it loses armor that has not been used to prevent damage this turn.</span></p><p class="p_style0"><span class="style6">If a creature has a “~” symbol in its armor ﬁeld, the creature has no</span></p><p class="p_style0"><span class="style3">armor. Such creatures may gain armor through card effects.</span></p><p class="p_style1"><span class="style6">If a creature with the assault (X) keyword gains another instance of the assault (X) keyword, the two X values are added together.</span></p><p class="p_style1"><span class="style3">If the word “before” is used in an ability (for example, “</span><span class="style12">Before Reap:</span><span class="style3">” or “</span><span class="style12">Before Fight:</span><span class="style6">”), that ability resolves before resolving the game effect of the reap or ﬁght (but after the card exhausts, if exhausting is required to use the card).</span></p><p class="p_style1"><span class="style4">If two card effects are simultaneously instructing a player that they “cannot” do something and that they “must” or “may” do the same thing, the “cannot” effect takes precedence.</span></p><p class="p_style55"><span class="style13">Example</span><span class="style4">:</span><span class="style4"> </span><span class="style232"> Anna controls a Pitlord (COTA 093) which reads “While Pitlord is in play you must choose Dis as your active house.” On their next turn Anna’s opponent plays Restringuntus (COTA 094) which reads</span><span class="style232"> </span><span class="style231"> “</span><span class="style230">Play</span><span class="style232">: Choose a house. Your opponent cannot choose that house as their active house until Restringuntus leaves play.” and chooses Dis for its ability. On Anna’s next turn, she both must and cannot choose Dis, but because cannot takes precedence over must, she only cannot choose Dis and must choose one of her other houses instead.</span></p><p class="p_style1"><span class="style4">If two card effects are simultaneously instructing a player that they cannot do something and that they may do something, the “cannot” effect takes precedence.</span></p><p class="p_style1"><span class="style3">Captured Æmber is taken from an opponent’s Æmber pool and placed on a creature controlled by the capturing player. Players may not spend captured Æmber.</span></p><p class="p_style1"><span class="style3">When a creature with Æmber on it leaves play, the Æmber is placed in the opponent’s Æmber pool.</span></p><p class="p_style1"><span class="style6">Unless otherwise speciﬁed, Æmber is placed on the creature that</span><span class="style6"> </span><span class="style3"> captured it.</span></p><p class="p_style1"><span class="style6">If a player has at least one chain when reﬁlling their hand and would</span><span class="style6"> </span><span class="style3"> draw cards based on the number of remaining cards in their hand, they draw fewer cards according to the chart below.

Behind, an angry mountain of scales, teeth, and hate—ahead a fall to certain death. So Dodger hurled himself out into Luck-knew-what, felt his hands catch on a rough tangle of razorwhip vines, and swung himself out and up as the crystal shattered behind him.</span></p><p class="p_style51"><span class="style234">The toothy thing behind him let out a roar so loud that Dodger’d swear it gave his swing just the ﬂing it needed to land him on the far side of the ravine. He teetered on that edge, saw the glimmering spears of the crystal canyon below, the grand sweep of the golden plains beyond, the shining swamp, the shadow of the Sanctum above, till he ﬁnally tottered off his teeter onto the Lucky side of things.</span></p><p class="p_style0"><span class="style234">Safe. For a moment.</span></p><p class="p_style51"><span class="style234">He took a deep breath and ﬁddled with his damn cloak. It was out of Æmber. No fading into the shadows for Dodger, not now anyhow. “Ah, it’s no fun when it’s easy anyway,” he muttered, glancing down into the ravine. The teeth with legs—too many legs—had scrambled down the cliff face and reared up, snufﬂing the sky with its scaly serpentine snout.</span></p><p class="p_style75"><span class="style234">“What did you do, tiny?” Valdr’s voice boomed with laughter as she stepped to the edge of the cliff, watching the beast scrabble forward. Dodger looked up, and up, and up, two or three Dodgers high to where the Brobnar giant’s head was haloed by the sun far above.</span></p><p class="p_style74"><span class="style283">He ﬂashed his best grin, his getting-out-of-trouble grin, his teeth white in the shadows of his inky-dark face, like a ﬂashing knife in the shadows proper.</span></p><p class="p_style75"><span class="style234">“Yes,” she said. “But the material alone isn’t enough, Dodger. Courage is what makes this key.” She reached out one perfect ﬁnger to touch the broken beast’s broken snout. Dodger wondered what the others saw when they looked at her, at Onyx. To him, she was a vision, an elf like him but yet unlike, taller, radiant with light. Breath-taking, in the literal sense. She had some of the strength of Valdr’s Brobnar giants, too, powerful arms, broad shoulders…but the same dispassionate, terrible focus of the worst of the demons of Dis. When she looked at him, Dodger wasn’t certain if he was a bug on a pin in her collection, or her best earner, or her next meal.</span></p><p class="p_style51"><span class="style234">“Well its spines are Æmber, ain’t they?” said Dodger, ﬂicking one purple-black ﬁnger to where the crystalline spines piercing through its scales glowed with a blood-red light in the gloom of the ravine. “And herself needs Æmber, she said.”</span></p><p class="p_style51"><span class="style234">“And you’ve brought it straight to us,” Valdr said as the thing began climbing the rock wall toward them, all scrabble and snarl. “How thoughtful.” She lifted her rocket-hammer and thumbed the catch, wak-ing the engine that grumble-mumbled within its massive steel head. She frowned as Dodger slipped behind her, all innocence, ma’am. “What is it, do you know?”</span></p><p class="p_style0"><span class="style234">“Well, it’s a snufﬂegator, ain’t it,” said Dodger.</span></p><p class="p_style51"><span class="style234">“So you don’t know,” Valdr replied. As the snufﬂegator streaked over the edge of the cliff, teeth-and-roar ﬁrst, she brought her hammer down, a thunderbolt on its skull, bang! It twitched once, then lay still. “Gather that Æmber,” Valdr said, turning to go. “And you’re welcome.”</span></p><p class="p_style75"><span class="style234">Dodger giggled and extended his wrist-knife as he crouched by the thing’s dead head. Maybe he could skim a little Æmber off the top, recharge his cloak, spare a little for his guild back home? The Archon would never miss it, would she, wouldn’t grudge Dodger a little taste of the honey in the pot? He dug at the ﬁrst spine, feeling it warm and singing beneath his touch. But before he could decide whether to slip it into a hidden pocket or not, she was there: Miss “Onyx” Censorius, the Archon herself, leaning over him, as curious and beautiful and impossi-ble as ever.</span></p><p class="p_style75"><span class="style234">“Uh, hullo, m’lady,” Dodger managed, placing the Æmber spine on the ground next to him and starting on the next and never dreaming of taking a little of his own out, not faithful Dodger, no. “Plenty of good Æmber here. Should be more’n enough to forge you one of them keys you was asking for.”</span></p><p class="p_style76"><span class="style234">He realized she was still talking. “And for Courage, we must ﬁrst have Fear.” She stood, gathering up the last of Dodger’s</span></p><p class="p_style77"><span class="style234">Æmber spines, then tucked one into the inside pocket of his coat. “Be brave, Dodger. For me?” She smiled and Dodger nodded, dumbstruck.</span></p><p class="p_style78"><span class="style234">“Brave about what?” he wondered, as the ﬁrst of the snuf-ﬂegator’s starving children squirmed free from its body, teeth-ﬁrst…</span></p><span id="page15"></span><div class="layout_style26"></div><p class="p_style0"><span class="style91">T</span><span class="style16">HE CRUCIBLE</span></p><p class="p_style0"><span class="style284">“I got a pretty good look as the Quantum was breaking apart on approach.</span></p><p class="p_style74"><span class="style285">A massive planet, an unﬁnished shell above, and that world-piercing,</span><span class="style285"> </span><span class="style286"> impossible spire.

It has gravity (some-times more, sometimes less), an atmosphere (sometimes breathable, sometimes toxic). Plants, animals, mineral formations, ruins of civiliza-tions gone by—to walk on the Crucible is to explore not just one alien world, but all of them. From the ﬂoating cities of the Sanctum to the crystal forests of the Æmberwood, from the towering shoulders of Sleeping Giant Mountain to the quicksilver pools of Arygrum Bog, from the windswept red plains of Nova Hellas to the bottomless canyons of Echoing Deep, there is no end to the wonders the Crucible has to offer.</span></p><p class="p_style75"><span class="style234">And the people! From a hundred thousand worlds and a hundred million cultures, all living shoulder-to-shoulder-to-tentacle across the Crucible. Whether in roving bands or quiet villages or bustling cities, towering fortresses or serene temples, merchants or brigands or kings or scientists, the people! With so many different species and cultures living side-by-side, the old nations and empires of the homeworlds are gone—mostly. The elves of the Shadows or the Brobnar tribes might still keep their own communities aloof, but they also walk the streets of the Crucible’s many cities, just like everyone else. The Martian Empire might be a bunch of conquering xenophobes, but their people still slip away to catch the latest Rolling Bugs concert just like everyone else. The innu-merable houses of the Crucible, many of them rose up on the Crucible itself, but even the ones that came from a homeworld, like the Shadows, now count aliens among their number. The Crucible changes everyone, given enough time.</span></p><p class="p_style75"><span class="style234">If nothing else, it changes your perspective. Because above it all rises the Spire, that impossible tower that rises from the pole and climbs to space. And from the spire spreads, what? An unﬁnished layer of the Crucible? A mighty spaceport, reserved for the use of the Architects? Who can guess? But stare into the clear blue sky long enough, and you’ll swear you see the trusses and scaffolding of a world under con-struction. The Crucible, impossible and gigantic and artiﬁcial, and ever growing, ever evolving.</span></p><p class="p_style0"><span class="style1">A</span><span class="style2">RCHONS</span></p><p class="p_style51"><span class="style286">“To a shy lad from a tiny village, it was like an angel had come down to walk among us.

That must be the Crucible’s purpose.”</span></p><p class="p_style82"><span class="style287">— Miss “Onyx” Censorius, Archon</span></p><p class="p_style74"><span class="style234">Life on the Crucible came from elsewhere. This is widely understood, widely acknowledged. Disparate worlds, mashed together and nudged along by the robotic fairies that most assume are creations of the Architects, all kept in some sort of balance. Then what is unique to the Crucible?</span></p><p class="p_style51"><span class="style234">The answer seems to be the archons. Child gods, or manifestations of a central AI, or transcended mortals, or beings of pure energy. No one knows. The archons themselves don’t know or won’t tell. But they travel across the Crucible, studying the people and animals they ﬁnd, always eager to learn more about their surroundings.</span></p><p class="p_style51"><span class="style234">The archons are strange beings, difﬁcult for mere mortals to under-stand. They have bodies only when they choose to, existing at other times as a disembodied consciousness or glowing energy being. The only trait that they all seem to share is their ability to speak to all sentient beings. Otherwise, they are as diverse in appearance and char-acter as the Crucible itself.</span></p><p class="p_style75"><span class="style234">Archons commonly seek out companions for their journeys, and they are always on the lookout for the mysterious vaults of the Crucible, secret caches of wisdom, power, or understanding that only the archons can access. To open a vault, archons must contest with one another in a race to gather the necessary æmber and forge the keys the vault requires. This contest has elements of a sacred ritual, a sporting event, and a bareknuckle back-alley brawl, all mixed together. The exchanges almost inevitably turn violent, but deaths are rare. In fact, thanks to the advanced technology and unusual abilities available to archons, most such contests are advantageous to their followers. When the archons successfully open a vault, they ﬁnd within a treasure trove of wisdom, technology, and some undeﬁnable energy that the archons absorb directly. Aside from this unique energy, the spoils of the vault are com-monly shared with the archon’s followers—a powerful incentive to join an archon’s company.</span></p><p class="p_style75"><span class="style234">For some, the promise of such treasure is reason enough to follow an archon into danger, but others have nobler intentions. Traveling with an archon is always exciting, a never-ending cavalcade of the unexpect-ed. On the Crucible, “exciting” is often synonymous with “deadly,” but archons can possess powers and abilities to keep their followers (rela-tively) safe, from healing powers to the gift of foresight. If nothing else, the archon’s gift of tongues can let their followers meet peaceably with other tribes and nations with whom they would otherwise have no way to communicate. Archons of a more warlike bent may attract followers who wish to keep their communities safe, or who relish the chance to lash out against enemies known and unknown. There’s always someone willing to risk everything in service to such a powerful and enigmatic</span><span class="style234"> </span><span class="style233"> being.</span></p><p class="p_style75"><span class="style234">And when the archons open enough vaults and move on, to wherever it is archons go, their followers are usually left better off for the experi-ence. And only rarely suddenly abandoned deep in a hostile part of the Crucible where they will surely meet their doom.</span></p><div class="layout_style27"></div><p class="p_style0"><span class="style288">KEYS</span></p><p class="p_style75"><span class="style289">I helped Miss Onyx forg</span><span class="style290">e h</span><span class="style289">er th</span><span class="style290">ird key</span><span class="style289">.

Additional houses may reveal themselves in the future.</span></p><p class="p_style0"><span class="style10">B</span><span class="style11">ROBNAR</span></p><p class="p_style51"><span class="style234">Whether they’re descending from snowy mountaintops to raid, riding grumbling motorsteeds across the blast-ed wastes, or laughing in the rain on the stormy seas, the warclans of the Brobnar are always a fearsome sight. A varied people, each Brobnar warclan is ruled by the strongest—whether that strength is shown on the ﬁeld of battle, in the Champion’s Ring, or demonstrated by sheer force of personality and brilliance.</span></p><p class="p_style0"><span class="style293">SOCIETY</span></p><p class="p_style51"><span class="style234">Although the oral traditions of the giants describe a journey from the mythical land of Vanhalla, most scholars believe that the Brobnar cul-ture as it exists today was created on the Crucible, perhaps through a merger of the early giants and the ﬁrst goblin tribes they encountered. Through the centuries, the Brobnar have evolved their own unique identity, independent of any of the member tribes they have absorbed.</span></p><p class="p_style75"><span class="style234">First, the Brobnar value strength above all. In Brobnar society, each is entitled only to what their strength allows them to take, and an oppo-nent or rival without the strength to defend their property has no claim to it. Second, Brobnar are very conscious of their image and the projec-tion of strength—to be seen as weak is the same as being weak. Third, the Brobnar love loud music, strong alcohol, and shiny things.</span></p><p class="p_style51"><span class="style234">To the rest of the Crucible, the Brobnar are dangerous enemies and valuable allies. Some warclans extract tribute from their neighbors, and others hire themselves off as mercenaries. Many Brobnar spend time living with other peoples, showing off Brobnar strength and learning (sometimes painfully) about life on the Crucible. Every now and again, one learns the most valuable lesson of all: that as strong as they are apart, every giant, goblin, or other creature is stronger working togeth-er…and when this happens, the whole Crucible trembles!</span></p><p class="p_style51"><span class="style234">Most Brobnar are giants, powerful humanoid creatures nearly 3 meters tall with mottled skin in a variety of shades. They tend to wear their hair in brightly-colored crests, with long beards for those who care to grow them, and adorn themselves with tattoos and sigils of their clan. The Gargantes clan, for example, decorates their bodies with blue tattoos to celebrate their escape from the Ice-Maze of the Robo-Sorcerer. (The Gargantes treasure horde also features the Skull of the Sorcerer, which looks almost exactly like a tin can.)</span></p><p class="p_style75"><span class="style234">Long ago, a large population of small, clever goblins joined the Brob-nar people. They are mostly relegated to second-class, servant status due to their small size and perceived weakness, but goblins are a tough gritty breed, and a handful of them have risen as respected leaders and shamans even among the giants.</span></p><p class="p_style75"><span class="style234">The Brobnar, on the whole, will accept anyone into their clans, so long as that person is strong-willed and eager to ﬁght!</span></p><p class="p_style0"><span class="style293">TECHNOLOGY</span></p><p class="p_style75"><span class="style234">Although they seem brutish and simple to some more civilized peoples, Brobnar are great proponents of any technology that is loud, destruc-tive, or preferably both. A violent people prone to injury and misad-venture, they make widespread use of cybernetic replacements and augmentation. They favor weapons that allow them to engage their enemies directly and revel in their great strength, but even their axes, hammers, and smashing gauntlets are often enhanced with engines, rockets, and other innovations that make them louder and more pow-erful. (Also, in many cases, more dangerous to the user, but Brobnar don’t usually mind that.) Since they value strength, they use their æmber as a source of power for certain machines, or even adorn their bodies with it to make themselves stronger.</span></p><p class="p_style83"><span class="style234">Brobnar goods are individually hand-made by artisans, with mini-mal existing industrial infrastructure. As such, they are made to last and an artisan whose products are durable, beautiful, and noisy can be as esteemed as any warrior. Brobnar also have a keen eye (and ear) for beauty…by Brobnar standards. Others may ﬁnd their art and music to be, mainly, “loud.”</span></p><p class="p_style84"><span class="style293">ARCHONS</span></p><p class="p_style85"><span class="style234">Brobnar are an intensely physical people and ﬁnd the more ethereal nature of the archons puzzling. If an archon wants the respect of the Brobnar, they must manifest physically and then display strength of either will or body, neither of which is generally difﬁcult for archons. Once they have proven themselves, archons ﬁnd that the Brobnar are loyal and excellent companions, jovial and direct. Many archons with Brobnar allies ﬁnd themselves wearing physical bodies more and more often, enjoying the simple and universal pleasures of such a form.</span></p><span id="page17"></span><div class="layout_style29"></div><p class="p_style0"><span class="style10">D</span><span class="style11">IS</span></p><p class="p_style51"><span class="style234">There are stories told across the Crucible of terrible monsters that dwell in the space between worlds. These creatures burst forth from the ground to terrify innocent people, their capering imps stealing æmber and their powerful demons destroying any who would oppose them. Those unlucky or foolish enough to travel to their netherworld home, known as Dis, are never heard from again.</span></p><p class="p_style0"><span class="style293">SOCIETY</span></p><p class="p_style51"><span class="style234">The half-living demons, the stories continue, are creatures of the between-worlds and so they have no life, no pain, no joy to call their own. Instead, they must steal these things from the innocent people of the Crucible. They seek out the most extreme emotions and consume them for sustenance. Where there is great rage, there lurks a demon, stoking the ﬁres of animosity and harvesting the emotions, the very soul, of the wrathful being. Greed, fear, suffering—all these emotions, the demons cause in mortal folk in order to harvest them and return them to their evil lairs.</span></p><p class="p_style0"><span class="style293">TECHNOLOGY</span></p><p class="p_style75"><span class="style234">The Theorists of Logos deride such tales as superstitious folly, and explain that the demons are merely parasitic beings that make their home in the suprastructure of the Crucible that divides this layer from the one below it. Emotionally numb due to the lack of stimulus in this space, the “demons” use the psycho-reactive properties of æmber to capture emotional and mental imprints of other residents of the Crucible, returning them to Dis for later study or perhaps recreational</span><span class="style234"> </span><span class="style233"> experience.</span></p><p class="p_style75"><span class="style234">Dis machines are part sorcery and part high technology, and the demons infuse æmber into every facet of their devices so that they, too, can capture the emotions of their victims. The furnaces of Dis burn with intense heat, where their black iron is smelted, and “souls” (or imprint-ed emotions) are broken down into their core elements for demonic consumption. These same blasted æmber shards are then incorporated into the imps and other self-aware machines used by the demons, and sent out to gather more æmber and more souls.</span></p><p class="p_style86"><span class="style234">The fact that these theories are exactly the same as the “superstitious” stories with fancier words is one those same Theorists dismiss as hooey, repeating the exact same explanation, only slower.</span></p><p class="p_style74"><span class="style234">The demons of Dis are, despite the myths, creatures of ﬂesh and blood, or at least skin (or insectile chitin) and ichor, in addition to the techno-logical nightmare-horror of their many cybernetic augmentations. It is not clear whether all demons are of the same species beneath their cryptic masks, or whether demonhood is bestowed upon various crea-tures through some sinister process. Volunteers to study the question are, understandably, in short supply.</span></p><p class="p_style74"><span class="style234">The demons are served by imps, chaotic and often mischievous robotic beings, driven by an intelligence scarcely less frightening than their demonic masters.</span></p><p class="p_style0"><span class="style234">The less said of humans who join the faction willingly, the better.</span></p><p class="p_style74"><span class="style234">Even when not functionally required, Dis devices tend to have sharp edges, a scalding touch, spikes, and a host of other opportunities for the unwary to injure themselves.</span></p><p class="p_style0"><span class="style293">ARCHONS</span></p><p class="p_style75"><span class="style234">Archons are the only beings on the Crucible who can be said to truly communicate with the demons of Dis, and many of them ﬁnd the demons endlessly fascinating. Dis’s devotion to the extremes of sensa-tion and emotion may be particularly attractive to archons who struggle with empathizing with the mortal condition—some archons have even requested the demons introduce them personally to the concepts of pain and fear.</span></p><span id="page18"></span><img src="images/36.png" width="369" /><p class="p_style0"><span class="style10">L</span><span class="style11">OGOS</span></p><p class="p_style51"><span class="style234">The self-proclaimed “foremost” intellectuals and scholars on the Crucible are all found within the Society of Logic and Reason, or simply Logos. Any Logotarian would happily conﬁrm this fact if asked, or if not asked, or if given any opportunity to speak at all.</span></p><p class="p_style51"><span class="style234">Logos has devoted itself to the advancement of scientiﬁc knowledge and understanding, putting aside as many earthly (or at least ﬂeshly) concerns as it can manage through use of its advanced technology. Individual Logotarians often replace some or all of their bodies with machines over the years, allowing them to escape the distractions of a physical form, and continue their work long after sickness or death would otherwise claim them. In fact, the use of cybernetic bodies is so widespread that no one outside the Society can recall what the physical bodies of the original Logotarians looked like, or even if they came to the Crucible in their cybernetic forms to begin with. Logos itself remains silent on the matter.</span></p><p class="p_style0"><span class="style293">TECHNOLOGY</span></p><p class="p_style51"><span class="style234">Logos divides itself, in very broad terms, into two groups: Theorists and Mechanists. Each considers the other to be their intellectual inferior, and each is convinced that the most important contributions to science and technology have been made thanks to their efforts.</span></p><p class="p_style51"><span class="style234">Theorists concern themselves with the realm of pure reason and possibility, where new theories are constantly developed in an effort to decode the secrets of the universe, both as it is and as it might be. Anything that can be demonstrated through math and reason is seen as potentially true; everything else is to be regarded with suspicion and attacked rigorously until a theoretical model is found. Mechanists, on the other hand, deal with empirical data and the world as-it-is. A theory is useless if it cannot be tested, and a technology is unproven until it is built and shown to work.</span></p><p class="p_style87"><span class="style234">Logos is happy to accept brilliant members of all species into its ranks; after all, few of them keep their organic bodies for more than a century or two anyway.</span></p><p class="p_style75"><span class="style234">While some call Logos’s zealous commitment to advancing knowledge at any cost unethical, and describe some of their more inventive exper-iments as “deranged,” “catastrophic,” or “really very bad,” true Theorists scoff at such backward thinking. They understand that the secrets of the Crucible are far more important than the lives of any one individual or city, and that no progress was ever made without a few naked singulari-ty pinhole events warping local spacetime.</span></p><p class="p_style75"><span class="style234">Logos technology is among the most advanced on the Crucible, and it is incorporated into every phase of their lives—indeed, it is rare to ﬁnd a Logotarian who doesn’t have Logos technology built into their bodies. Whether it’s mag-tethered ﬂoating limbs (for easy modularity) or a quantum dissonance modulator (for…reasons), Logos machines are built for every conceivable purpose and also for some that aren’t.</span></p><p class="p_style75"><span class="style234">Because Logos is continually pushing the frontier of knowledge, many of their technologies are experimental or prototypical; some are never replicated because they do not work as well as desired (or work entirely too well in the wrong way). Some of these “machines” may have originated as organic beings—there is minimal ethics oversight on the experiments of the Logotarians.</span></p><p class="p_style88"><span class="style234">Many Logotarian machines incorporate æmber into their function, either as a power source or to harness some of its more esoteric properties. Others are designed expressly to investigate and ana-lyze æmber, a project which has remained stubbornly difﬁcult no matter how advanced Logos’s science becomes.</span></p><p class="p_style89"><span class="style293">ARCHONS</span></p><p class="p_style90"><span class="style234">For Logos, archons are one of the ultimate unsolved puzzles of the Crucible. They</span><span class="style234"> </span><span class="style233"> eagerly study archons and are happy to</span><span class="style233"> </span><span class="style234"> work with them to learn more of their nature. Since archons are also generally curious about their own nature, many join in Logos’s quest for knowledge.</span></p><span id="page19"></span><img src="images/37.png" width="405" /><p class="p_style0"><span class="style10">M</span><span class="style11">ARS</span></p><p class="p_style51"><span class="style234">Mars, as an empire, is exceptional in that it has remained a more-or-less unchanged political and cultural bloc after its relocation to the Crucible by the Architects two centuries ago. Perhaps due to the fact that the transition occurred during the ﬁnal days of the Fall of Mars, or perhaps simply based on Mars’ rela-tive-newcomer status, the Martian Empire has remained intact on the Crucible. It is still under the control of the Martian Elders and still aggressively dominating as much of the Crucible as they can manage in their xenophobic crusade to ensure that Mars Lives On.</span></p><p class="p_style51"><span class="style234">Now powered by æmber, rather than the cavorite that poisoned their home planet, Mars’s war machine has found some success, but also more difﬁcult and dangerous foes than they could have expected. New life forms on the Crucible mean more opportunities for Martian biological engineers to breed a perfect monster. New elements, such as æmber, provide more fodder for Martian scientists and engineers. But Martian soldiers with their ray guns and Martian vehicles with their blasters are not always victorious when pitted against Brobnar war-riors or swarms of Nifﬂe apes. For Mars to have true victory, they must reclaim the skies with their ﬂying saucers. Unfortunately, they have had only limited success in rebuilding the Martian ﬂeet, and some mysteri-ous force keeps their spaceships from rising above the atmosphere.</span></p><p class="p_style0"><span class="style293">TECHNOLOGY</span></p><p class="p_style75"><span class="style234">Still, by maintaining large cloning facilities and dropping their soldiers into combat from hovering motherships, the relatively weak (in a phys-ical sense) Martians have established themselves in Nova Hellas, and now control three entire cities. Tremble before the might of Mars!</span></p><p class="p_style74"><span class="style234">Martian technology was highly advanced when they were translocated to the Crucible and, despite needing to completely re-invent itself for its new context, has only become more sophisticated since. Martian soldiers go to war armed with powerful and mysterious weapons and piloting highly advanced, lethal walkers and ships, while genetical-ly-modiﬁed monstrosities are turned loose as a vanguard, hopefully against the enemies of Mars. (Perhaps unsurprisingly, most Martian technologies are either purpose-built for war, or soon turned to that purpose.)</span></p><p class="p_style51"><span class="style234">Unlike many other factions on the Crucible, Mars remains committed to genetic and cultural purity, that Mars may never die. Even before their translocation to the Crucible, Mars was using genetic enhancement technology and extensive cloning to divide their culture into two dis-tinct castes: the taller, more intelligent Elders, who rule over the smaller, weaker, and far more numerous Martian Soldiers.</span></p><p class="p_style51"><span class="style234">While the Soldier caste are expected to display utter loyalty to Mars and are discouraged (sometimes with cranial electro-correction) from devel-oping unique personalities, Elders are varied in their areas of expertise and interest, and have considerable leeway to indulge their personal desires. Some develop new biological weapons (whether plagues or horrifying monsters), some study the lesser beings and the Crucible, others archive Martian culture and history. Together, the Elders collec-tively rule the Martian Empire—all for the glory of Mars!</span></p><p class="p_style75"><span class="style234">While Mars once relied on cavorite to power its rayguns and levitate its ﬂying saucers, it has found a suitable substitute in the æmber found only on the Crucible. The psycho-reactive æmber seems to have unlocked the psychic potential of the Martian race, and new experi-ments in mind control, telepathy, and other psionic technologies prom-ise great things for the Martian future.</span></p><p class="p_style0"><span class="style293">ARCHONS</span></p><p class="p_style75"><span class="style234">To the Elders of Mars, archons are both potential threat and ally. Their wisdom and power is undeniable, but they carry with them an unde-niable potential to corrupt Martian purity with their foreign ideas and companions. Still, the threat is acceptable when the payoff is so high, and so the Elders tolerate fraternization with the archons (not that they have much of a choice). For their part, archons seldom get a chance to explore a society that has remained so wholly itself. And of course the gleeful belligerence of the Martian war machine is attractive in its own way.</span></p><span id="page20"></span><img src="images/38.png" width="326" /><p class="p_style0"><span class="style10">S</span><span class="style11">ANCTUM</span></p><p class="p_style51"><span class="style234">Floating as if by magic above the surface of the Cruci-ble are many large islands, improbable paradises of water, stone, and green growing things. Some believe that these islands are but the beginnings of a new layer of the Crucible, to be assembled by the Architects over the following millennia; others spec-ulate that this new layer is already under construction and these islands must be leftovers from that process.</span></p><p class="p_style51"><span class="style234">In any case, many of these islands are governed by and collectively referred to as the Sanctum. A theocratic nation-state uniﬁed by their gnostic faith and protected by the angelic Knights of the Sanctum (as well as various other knightly and crusading orders), the Sanctum is safe, clean, and pleasant, which is a rare combination for any realm on the Crucible. Wherever the golden wings of their knights spread, the innocent and just can rest easy, knowing that they are protected by the Church of the Opened Eye. (The deﬁnitions of the terms “innocent” and “just”, of course, are determined by the Church itself.)</span></p><p class="p_style75"><span class="style234">The bulk of the Sanctum’s ﬂesh-and-blood adherents are human beings, but certainly the Church of the Opened Eye does not have its origins on the human homeworld. It’s possible that the Sanctum and their faith were both created on the Crucible, perhaps in imitation of the archons with which early adherents must have been familiar. If the scholars and Grey Monks know, they are not sharing those secrets with</span><span class="style234"> </span><span class="style233"> the unenlightened.</span></p><p class="p_style0"><span class="style293">TECHNOLOGY</span></p><p class="p_style74"><span class="style234">Although they are sometimes literally above earthly concerns, the Sanctum has regular communication with the world below. Missionar-ies, ambassadors, and even merchants walk through the streets of the</span></p><p class="p_style91"><span class="style234">Crucible’s villages and cities, or even travel to wild and inhospitable places to bring the Sanc-tum’s truth to the unenlightened. Usual-ly, these travelers are welcomed, and when they are not, well, that’s what the Knights are for.</span></p><p class="p_style75"><span class="style234">The difference between a powerful Sanctum angel and an archon seems subtle to the point of meaninglessness to most believers of the Sanctum. From the point of view of the Church, archons are everything they believe made manifest: a pure soul, a perfect consciousness free of any limitations of physical form. Sanctum knights are eager to learn from such beings, and the archons, for their part, are often eager to be looked upon, treated, and worshipped as deities. Indeed, some archons are even up to the task, and strive to enhance the spiritual lives of their followers.</span></p><p class="p_style51"><span class="style234">The religion of the Sanctum teaches that through meditation, learning, and spiritual growth, a being can become enlightened and transcend their need for an earthly body. Many of the knights and the higher-rank-ing clergy are spiritual beings of pure energy; indeed, the mighty suits of powered armor worn by the knights are necessary containment devices for their spiritual selves, who otherwise could not affect the physical world at all. The gleaming wings and golden swords wielded by the knights to such impressive effect are the spiritual (some might say “psychic”) projections of the believer’s will, made possible by use of the sacred æmber, and further evidence of the divine and spiritual nature of all beings.</span></p><p class="p_style51"><span class="style234">Most of Sanctum’s spirits can only manifest in the hallowed halls of their cathedrals or through the sacred armor of the knights. The most power-ful spirits of the Sanctum, called “angels,” are no longer bound by such limitations, and seem to manifest their selves and will directly as beings of shining golden luminosity.</span></p><p class="p_style74"><span class="style234">There are still many creatures of ﬂesh and blood within the Sanctum’s ranks, however. Enlightenment is not found easily, and for many is more about the journey than the destination. Some even profess that Sanctum’s spirits were always energy beings and that Enlightenment and Transcendence are impossible, a scam that has been propagated throughout the ages to oppress the masses, but such heretics are swiftly silenced within the Sanctum itself.</span></p><p class="p_style75"><span class="style234">Sanctum’s signature technology is the glorious armor of its knights, powerful cybernetic suits that make ﬂesh-and-blood wearers stron-ger, healthier, and faster, and enable great feats on the part of knightly spirits.</span></p><p class="p_style75"><span class="style234">Much of Sanctum’s technology relies on the “spiritual energy” of its user, and æmber is incorporated to act as a conduit. For the knights, this energy is often channelled into wings and halos of golden light, which give the warriors superior mobility and tactical awareness on the battleﬁeld. Their weapons, too, are enhanced by golden energy, creat-ing blades of pure light, shields that pulse with power, and other effects that reﬂect and enhance a knight’s purpose.</span></p><p class="p_style75"><span class="style234">Aside from their knights, much of the Sanctum seems almost pastoral in its asceticism. The architecture is beautiful, but built with time-honored techniques that date from ages past. Records are maintained by hand and on paper, food is grown through honest toil, and in general virtue, simplicity, and peace are valued. At least for the laity; the cathedrals themselves are monuments to inner light and the glory of the Sanctum, of course, and for them no expense shall be spared.</span></p><p class="p_style0"><span class="style293">ARCHONS</span></p><span id="page21"></span><img src="images/39.png" width="367" /><p class="p_style0"><span class="style10">S</span><span class="style11">HADOWS</span></p><p class="p_style51"><span class="style234">The Svarr elves that dwell in the Shadows are a motley collection of rogues, conﬁdence artists, thieves, and sometime-assassins. Physically unimposing, the elves make up for it with speed, cleverness, and a light-ﬁn-gered approach to other people’s possessions and</span><span class="style234"> </span><span class="style233"> technology.</span></p><p class="p_style74"><span class="style234">Loosely organized into a series of like-minded guilds, the Svarr are a curious mixture of selﬁsh and selﬂess. They will sacriﬁce much for the good of their guild, and yet ruthlessly exploit any opportunities presented by outsiders, robbing, cheating, and stealing for their own advantage without hesitation or regret.</span></p><p class="p_style51"><span class="style234">Svarr histories hold that they once dwelled in a land of light and peace, but were exiled to the Shadows, where they were forced to hide and scavenge in order to survive. It isn’t clear whether this exile predates their translocation to the Crucible or if the myth (if myth it is) is directly based on that translocation, but whatever the case they hold the story as justiﬁcation for any and all misdeeds. Fortunately for the Svarr, they are extremely talented in all arts of stealth, misdirection, and repurpos-ing other people’s tools.</span></p><p class="p_style0"><span class="style293">TECHNOLOGY</span></p><p class="p_style74"><span class="style234">Most Shadows technology is stolen or scavenged from someone else and then repurposed for Shadows use. Some Shadows operatives have even managed to reprogram the faeries that steward the Crucible’s biospheres, using them as scouts, saboteurs, assistants, and simply as pets (they are cute, after all).</span></p><p class="p_style75"><span class="style234">Many are confused by what, precisely, the Shadows are—a nation, a place, a state of mind? The Svarr are pragmatic about it: anyplace they hide, anyplace they do their business, that’s the Shadows. The best thieves can ﬁnd the Shadows anywhere.</span></p><p class="p_style75"><span class="style234">If the Shadows have one piece of technology that is uniquely theirs, it is their cloaks, clever stealth emitters that surround them with an invisibil-ity ﬁeld. Shadows elves frequently wear the distinctive three-dot stealth emitters all over their outﬁts for complete coverage of invisibility or illu-sion technology, as required. Using their cloaks, the thieves and rogues can always return to the Shadows whenever they need.</span></p><p class="p_style51"><span class="style234">Most of the thieves in the Shadows are from the Svarr tribe of elves, a diminutive, dark, large-eyed people with wicked grins and sharp senses. Clannish and suspicious of outsiders, the Svarr dominate every Shadows guild. Svarr can also be found living and working alongside beings of all species in all sorts of places and under all sorts of creeds and governments. But these individuals may also be Shadows, because a good thief can blend in anywhere.</span></p><p class="p_style74"><span class="style234">Humans and other aliens sometimes fall in with the Shadows guilds. After all, crime isn’t unique to the Svarr and they’ll recruit any asset that seems useful. Some of these recruits ﬁnd themselves more at home in the Shadows than in their homelands, and eventually join a guild full-time, where they are, after proving themselves, as welcome as any Svarr.</span></p><p class="p_style0"><span class="style293">ARCHONS</span></p><p class="p_style75"><span class="style234">The Svarr have a simple means of assessing anything that isn’t of their guild: can it help, or is it a threat? Archons are clearly both, so they must be approached with care. But if one can be turned to an ally, then the dividends paid to the guild could be extreme. If nothing else, archons can apparently speak to anyone or anything, so they can help arrange deals and trades in the Shadows. Archons, who have to be introduced to the concepts of “personal property” and “ownership” by others at some point, ﬁnd the Shadows interpretation of such concepts intrigu-ing. The balance of “me ﬁrst” and “anything for a mate” that deﬁnes Svarr culture is one that many archons ﬁnd eminently sensible.</span></p><span id="page22"></span><div class="layout_style30"></div><p class="p_style0"><span class="style10">U</span><span class="style11">NTAMED</span></p><p class="p_style51"><span class="style234">The Architects brought together plants, animals, and other lifeforms from all across the universe to populate their Crucible. In fact, they continue to do so, blending together alien biomes into something, if not quite harmonious, at least verdantly and bois-terously alive.</span></p><p class="p_style51"><span class="style234">The various wild creatures of the Crucible are tended to by mechanical faeries, quirky automatons that do their best to keep a semblance of balance in place. But while they struggle to maintain this balance, the faeries make no attempt to keep the wildlife segregated, and so wolves from Earth may soon ﬁnd themselves hunted by Martian snekgarrs, Nifﬂe apes from Regulus Prime hang from the branches of the slow-blooming nepenthe tree of Visgard, and Alpha Centaurian sugar ants are consumed by Venusian ﬂytraps. (Not to be confused with the surprisingly-similar plants from Earth.) Over time, these species evolve to ﬁnd a comfortable home on the Crucible, even blending and interbreeding with aliens where they ﬁnd compatible biology (sometimes aided by faeries and the strange mutations wrought by wild æmber). While some of these animals may still be recognizable as similar to the beasts on their planets of origin, others are wholly and forevermore creatures of the Crucible, and found nowhere else in the universe.</span></p><p class="p_style0"><span class="style293">TECHNOLOGY</span></p><p class="p_style74"><span class="style234">The Untamed as a whole do not use technology, since most scholarly distinctions between sentient being and wild beast revolve around its use. Still, there is some blurriness at the edges, and while Nifﬂe apes may be considered animals, they do fashion crude jewelry and use simple tools when appropriate. The faeries of the wilderness are all machines, as well, and there are some truly strange examples of syn-thetic life in the galaxy that confuse the line ever further.</span></p><p class="p_style75"><span class="style234">Collectively, these wild creatures are referred to as the Untamed. Together with the humans and other sentients who reject civilization and retreat to the wild, they form a large and chaotic faction of their own. With no central organization (indeed, in many cases with no true intelligence) to speak of, the only constant to the Untamed is that they live true to their natures, whatever those natures may be.</span></p><p class="p_style75"><span class="style234">Many of the sentients who might be considered Untamed have walked away from most technology, but even in the wild places of the Crucible there are machines and tech to be scavenged and repurposed. Most civilizations will eventually succumb to the wild, after all.</span></p><p class="p_style51"><span class="style294">Since the Untamed includes, by deﬁnition, every wild creature, plant, fungus, or other living thing on the Crucible, its diversity is impossible to overstate, but we’ll try: it’s very diverse. As for the sentient beings best described as “people” (of whatever species), they have more commonalities. Some were raised in civilized societies and turned away from them. Others have only ever lived in the wild. All are more comfortable under the open sky of the Crucible than in the cities of stone and steel, more able to converse with the beasts and birds than with their fellow sentients.</span></p><p class="p_style74"><span class="style294">Some of these sentients, perhaps thanks to liberal consumption and use of æmber, have developed a near-supernatural ability to speak not only to animals, but to plants and fungus as well. Their abilities seem like magic, and many call these people “witches,” or by other names drawn from their own mythologies. But they are harmless. Mostly.</span></p><p class="p_style0"><span class="style293">ARCHONS</span></p><p class="p_style75"><span class="style234">The minds of the animals present a unique test of an archon’s vaunted ability to communicate with any denizen of the Crucible. Some are drawn to the uncomplicated thought patterns of the Untamed, consid-ering them a calming inﬂuence and a source of comfort. Other archons are drawn to the sense of wild and natural freedom these creatures exhibit. For the most part, the Untamed beasts are happy to ignore anything that is neither predator nor prey, but some particularly social animals (and people) enjoy the undemanding company of an archon during their travels.</span></p><span id="page23"></span><div class="layout_style31"></div><p class="p_style0"><span class="style16">ON RADIANT WINGS</span></p><p class="p_style0"><span class="style12">by Daniel Lovat Clark</span></p><p class="p_style51"><span class="style234">He felt the Vault’s presence like a chord that thrummed music through-out his body. Not that he had a body, exactly, not like the humans and the cyborgs and the creatures who followed him. In that way, at least, he felt a closer kinship to the ethereal spirits of Sanctum, but their wispy forms of pure psyche, bound as they were in heavy suits of knightly armor, were still more limited than him.</span></p><p class="p_style74"><span class="style234">He could become anything. He knew that, felt that, deep inside. But becoming that anything—it was out of reach until he opened the Vault. Some part of himself was still locked away, waiting for him to ﬁnd it. He could be anything, even wear a body for a time, but he couldn’t be, fully, until he was whole.</span></p><p class="p_style51"><span class="style234">Argus pulled himself inward, fell back into the body-shape he wore most often, radiant wings ﬂuttering behind, white robes billowing around a form held together by gleaming energy. It was an impressive look, and the reason they called him Radiant Argus the Supreme. He stepped forward, to where Sergeant Zakiel knelt with his dimmed aura. “Rise,” Argus said, his voice thrumming through mind as much as air.</span></p><p class="p_style75"><span class="style234">“There is another Archon near the Vault, sire,” said Zakiel, falling into step alongside his Archon. Together, they walked past the remains of an ancient structure, plated in gold dataweave, part temple, part comput-er. Argus had been studying the ruin when he felt the Vault’s call, had</span> <span class="style234">determined that it had stood when this part of the world had been added to the Crucible. Its makers were a mystery; perhaps they had not come along with their temple when the Architects brought it here.</span></p><p class="p_style74"><span class="style234">Zakiel, blind to these mysteries, continued speaking. “Miss ‘Onyx’ Censorius,” he said. “She has her own cadre of warriors, demons, and thieves.”</span></p><p class="p_style51"><span class="style234">“A rival,” said Argus. He felt the music of the Vault shift, the chord tauten within him. The greater the struggle to open a Vault, the greater the reward. Did the Vaults reveal themselves explicitly to provoke these challenges? Or did the rewards within shift in response to the difﬁculty the Archon who opened it faced? He didn’t know. Who could guess the motives of the Architects? Perhaps that knowledge was locked in a Vault.</span></p><p class="p_style51"><span class="style234">“We must act swiftly.” He could feel her now, reaching out, a dark and dissonant presence. She was ahead of him, had already gathered Æmber for her ﬁrst key. But if she opened the Vault, then that part of himself that was locked away would go to her instead. “Zakiel, ﬁnd two of the batdrones and take to the sky. Strike down upon her coterie, while we gather the Æmber in this valley.”</span></p><p class="p_style75"><span class="style234">“It’s to be battle, then, my liege?” Zakiel asked, his aura ﬂaring and his wings ﬂickering into existence.</span></p><p class="p_style87"><span class="style234">“It’s always battle,” Argus said, looking toward the Vault. Its song grew louder still. “How else are we to forge our perfect selves in the Crucible?</span></p><span id="page24"></span><img src="images/40.png" width="295" /><p class="p_style0"><span class="style91">T</span><span class="style16">HE ORIGIN OF KEYFORGE</span></p><p class="p_style92"><span class="style11">CREDITS</span></p><p class="p_style51"><span class="style234">In the early days of trading card games, they were played in many ways – and some of my favorite ways disappeared over time. Among those were sealed deck and league play. Both were awkward to manage because cards had a tendency to get lost in one’s collection. Also, play-ers could only play with trusted friends because it was easy to cheat by improving one’s deck surreptitiously.</span></p><p class="p_style51"><span class="style234">I have often wondered if I could get back some of that really exciting play, which was characterized by tools that weren’t universal. Each play-er had treasures no other player had, but also had less powerful cards that needed to be used in clever ways to get the most value. One’s sealed or league deck was never ideal – but it was unique, and there was a great deal of skill in getting the most out of it.</span></p><p class="p_style51"><span class="style234">While I enjoy constructing or drafting decks, I am often longing to play cards that are not powerful enough to compete within these formats. When playing with sealed or limited decks, these cards often become viable, since you can’t just replace them with top tier cards. I ﬁnd special pleasure in winning a game using cards that many people ignored or overlooked.</span></p><p class="p_style75"><span class="style234">I have always been attached to good procedurally generated content. Game worlds generated in this way really feel as if they belong to me, the player – I am discovering them as I play; the designer didn’t even know they existed. Often games without such content are extremely managed experiences; everyone goes through the same story lines and can experience the same gameplay by making the same decisions. Everything they experience feels planned. The contrast feels to me like the difference between exploring a jungle and walking in an amuse-ment park. When trading card games ﬁrst came out the feeling was like exploring a jungle – and as the cards became more like commodities, it became more and more like an amusement park.</span></p><p class="p_style75"><span class="style234">In the amusement park there are experts telling you how to play the game, the safest strategies, what net decks to use. In the jungle you have the tools you have. There is every chance that you are going to be the best in the world at playing your decks – you can’t just look up what the synergies are or the weaknesses; you will only ﬁnd out by playing.</span></p><p class="p_style28"><span class="style185">PLAYTESTERS</span></p><p class="p_style0"><span class="style3">Aaron Haltom, Alex Davy, Allie, Andrew Aarestad, Andrew Fischer,</span></p><p class="p_style0"><span class="style3">Andrew Gross, Benjamin Bottorff, Boyd Bottorff, Brian Weissman,</span></p><p class="p_style0"><span class="style234">Welcome to the jungle!</span></p><p class="p_style0"><span class="style3">Brodie Bensend, Bryden Cole, Bubbles the Hammer, Caleb “Bulldog”</span></p><p class="p_style0"><span class="style12">Game Design</span><span class="style6">: Richard Garﬁeld</span></p><p class="p_style1"><span class="style12">Game Development</span><span class="style3">: Brad Andres, Skaff Elias, and Nate French with Daniel Schaefer</span></p><p class="p_style93"><span class="style12">Producer</span><span class="style3">: Erik Dahlman</span><span class="style3"> </span><span class="style12"> Fiction</span><span class="style3">: Daniel Lovat Clark</span></p><p class="p_style2"><span class="style12">Editing</span><span class="style3">: Adam Baker and Kevin Tomczyk</span><span class="style3"> </span><span class="style12"> Card Game Manager</span><span class="style3">: Mercedes Opheim</span><span class="style3"> </span><span class="style12"> Story Manager</span><span class="style3">: Katrina Ostrander</span></p><p class="p_style1"><span class="style12">Graphic Design</span><span class="style3">: Christopher Hosch with Monica Helland, Michael Silsby, and Neal W.

These questions are presented in a “Question and Answer” format, with the newest questions at the end.</span></p><p class="p_style1"><span class="style12">My opponent has 14 Æmber in their pool and I have 0 in mine. At the start of my turn I select Shadows as the active house and play the card Bait and Switch (CoTA 267). How many times does Bait and Switch trigger?</span></p><p class="p_style99"><span class="style3">In this situation, Bait and Switch’s effect will be triggered 7 times. Each time the effect is triggered it will check if your opponent still has more</span></p><p class="p_style1"><span class="style6">Æmber than you, and if they do it will trigger again. So after the ﬁrst</span><span class="style6"> </span><span class="style3"> time the effect triggers you will have 1 Æmber and your opponent will have 13, the second time you will have 2 Æmber and your opponent will</span><span class="style3"> </span><span class="style6"> have 12, then 3 and 11, 4 and 10, 5 and 9, 6 and 8, then ﬁnally 7 and</span></p><p class="p_style1"><span class="style3">7. Once both players have the same amount of Æmber when the effect checks if your opponent has more Æmber than you the effect will see that your opponent does not and the card effect will not trigger again.</span></p><p class="p_style25"><span class="style12">Note</span><span class="style3">: Repeating an effect does not interact with the Rule of Six (see</span><span class="style3"> </span><span class="style6"> page 7), as the Rule of Six only applies to playing or using cards, not</span><span class="style6"> </span><span class="style3"> triggering their effect multiple times.</span></p><p class="p_style1"><span class="style227">Its the ﬁrst turn of the game and I am going ﬁrst. I choose house</span><span class="style227"> </span><span class="style12"> Logos to be the active house and play the card Phase Shift (CoTA 117). Does this allow me to play another card this turn even though the First Turn Rule (see page 5) is in effect?</span></p><p class="p_style1"><span class="style4">Playing Phase Shift will allow you to play another card from your hand</span><span class="style4"> </span><span class="style226"> this turn, since the First Turn Rule can be modiﬁed by card effects.</span></p><p class="p_style1"><span class="style227">Its the ﬁrst turn of the game and I am going ﬁrst. I choose house</span><span class="style227"> </span><span class="style12"> Logos to be the active house and play the card Wild Wormhole (CoTA 125). Can Wild Wormhole’s effect be resolved even though the First Turn Rule (see page 5) is in effect?</span></p><p class="p_style1"><span class="style6">Wild Wormhole’s effect can be resolved. The First Turn Rule speciﬁes</span><span class="style6"> </span><span class="style3"> that players cannot play or discard more than one card from their hand. However it does not prohibit cards from being played or discarded from other game areas, such as your deck.</span></p><p class="p_style1"><span class="style12">I have 2 chains and 7 cards in hand when moving to my draw cards step. Will I shed a chain during this step?</span></p><p class="p_style1"><span class="style3">No, you will not shed a chain during this draw cards step. Chains are only shed when a player would draw cards during the draw step and the</span><span class="style3"> </span><span class="style6"> chains prevent them from doing so (see “Chains” on Page 8). Since you</span><span class="style6"> </span><span class="style3"> already have 7 cards in your hand, you aren’t going to be drawing any cards, and thus don’t lose any of your chains.</span></p><p class="p_style1"><span class="style12">I have 2 chains and 5 cards in hand when moving to my draw cards step. Will I shed a chain during this step?</span></p><p class="p_style1"><span class="style3">Yes, you will shed a chain during this step. Chains are only shed when a player would draw cards during the draw step and the chains prevent</span><span class="style3"> </span><span class="style6"> them from doing so (see “Chains” on Page 8). You only have 5 cards in hand, and normally you would draw a card to reﬁll your hand. However</span><span class="style6"> </span><span class="style3"> because of the chains you are prevented from drawing that card. Since you would normally have drawn the card and the chain prevented it, you then shed 1 chain.</span></p><p class="p_style1"><span class="style12">I have chosen house Logos to be my active house this turn and start off by playing Library Access (CoTA 115), I then play Wild Wormhole (CoTA 125). In what order do I resolve this combination of effects?</span></p><p class="p_style1"><span class="style3">When you play a Wild Wormhole after playing a Library Access the following happens in this order:</span></p><ul><li><p class="p_style0"><span class="style3">1. You gain 1 Æmber from Wild Wormhole’s Æmber bonus.</span></p></li><li><p class="p_style0"><span class="style3">2. You draw a card from Library Access’s effect.</span></p></li><li><p class="p_style1"><span class="style3">3. You resolve Wild Wormhole’s effect and play the top card of your deck.</span></p></li></ul><ul><li><p class="p_style0"><span class="style3">4. You gain Æmber from any Æmber bonus on the played card.</span></p></li><li><p class="p_style0"><span class="style3">5. You draw a card from Library Access’s effect.</span></p></li><li><p class="p_style1"><span class="style3">6. You resolve any play effects on the card played from the top of your deck.</span></p></li></ul><p class="p_style1"><span class="style13">I have the card Pitlord (CoTA 093) in play and my opponent plays the card Restringuntus (CoTA 094) and chooses house Dis. What happens when I try to declare my house on my next turn?</span></p><p class="p_style1"><span class="style4">On your next turn, during the choose a house step, you will be in a</span><span class="style4"> </span><span class="style226"> position where you must choose house Dis (because of the Pitlord), but also cannot choose house Dis (because of the Restringuntus). Cannot</span><span class="style226"> </span><span class="style4"> effects have precedence over must effects, thus you cannot choose Dis.</span></p><p class="p_style1"><span class="style226">(see “Cannot Vs Must” on Page 9.) You may still choose either one of</span><span class="style226"> </span><span class="style4"> your other houses though.</span></p><p class="p_style1"><span class="style13">I have a Faygin (CoTA 300) in play and my opponent has an Urchin (CoTA 315) in play. I reap with Faygin and with its reap effect I choose my opponent’s Urchin. What happens?</span></p><p class="p_style1"><span class="style4">Faygin’s effect causes the Urchin to try and go into your hand, however when a card leaves play it always goes to its owner’s corresponding out</span><span class="style4"> </span><span class="style226"> of play zone (See “Leaves Play” on Page 11) unless the card causing it to leave play speciﬁes otherwise. The Urchin is returned to your opponent’s</span><span class="style226"> </span><span class="style4"> hand instead of yours.</span></p><p class="p_style1"><span class="style13">I have 0 Æmber in my Æmber pool and have chosen house Logos to be my active house this turn. I play Wild Wormhole (CoTA 125) and</span><span class="style13"> </span><span class="style302"> try and play the top card of my deck is Keliﬁ Dragon (CoTA 037).</span></p><p class="p_style0"><span class="style13">What happens?</span></p><p class="p_style1"><span class="style226">The Keliﬁ Dragon is returned to the top of the deck. Keliﬁ Dragon has a</span><span class="style226"> </span><span class="style4"> play requirement of needing to have 7 Æmber in your Æmber pool, and since you didn’t have any initially (you now have 1 from playing the Wild</span></p><p class="p_style0"><span class="style226">Wormhole) you don’t have enough to be able to play the Keliﬁ Dragon.</span></p><p class="p_style1"><span class="style4">Since you can’t play the card it is returned to the place you tried to play it from, in this case the top of the deck.</span></p><p class="p_style1"><span class="style13">On my opponent’s turn they use their Yxilo Bolter (CoTA 204) to reap and choose to resolve its reap effect on my Bad Penny (CoTA 296). Is the Bad Penny purged or does it end up back in my hand?</span></p><p class="p_style0"><span class="style4">The Bad Penny goes back to your hand. “</span><span class="style13">Destroyed</span><span class="style4">:” effects (see</span></p><p class="p_style1"><span class="style226">“Destroyed” on Page 10) happen immediately before a creature is</span><span class="style226"> </span><span class="style4"> destroyed, meaning that Bad Penny is back in its owner’s hand before the Yxilo Bolter can try to purge it with its reap effect. At that point, any pending effects waiting to resolve on Bad Penny no longer do. This is because Bad Penny is moving to an out-of-play zone in which the identity of cards is hidden from the opponent (see “Leaves Play” on</span></p><p class="p_style0"><span class="style226">Page 11).</span></p><span id="page26"></span><div class="layout_style33"></div><p class="p_style1"><span class="style13">I have a stunned creature in my battleline, play the card Anger (CoTA 001), and choose to resolve its effect on that stunned creature. What happens?</span></p><p class="p_style1"><span class="style226">If a card (such as Anger in this case) allows you to use a creature and</span><span class="style226"> </span><span class="style4"> if the creature you are trying to use is stunned, you remove the stun instead of doing anything else. Since Fighting is a type of being used the creature is exhausted and the stun counter is removed.</span></p><p class="p_style1"><span class="style4">This will even work if your opponent has no creatures in play, because</span><span class="style4"> </span><span class="style226"> unstunning replaces the normal “use” (in this case ﬁght) of the card</span><span class="style226"> </span><span class="style4"> before it begins.</span></p><p class="p_style1"><span class="style13">I have chosen house Logos to be my active house this turn and play a Phase Shift (COTA 117) then play another copy of Phase Shift. How many non-Logos cards can I play this turn?</span></p><p class="p_style1"><span class="style4">You can play two non-Logos cards this turn. Each copy of Phase Shift that you play allows you to play an additional non-Logos card.</span></p><p class="p_style1"><span class="style13">I have a Stealer of Souls (CoTA 098) in play and my opponent has a</span><span class="style13"> </span><span class="style302"> Valdr (CoTA 029). I use my Stealer of Souls to ﬁght Valdr and both</span><span class="style302"> </span><span class="style13"> creatures are destroyed. Does the Stealer of Souls’ ability trigger?</span></p><p class="p_style1"><span class="style4">No, the Stealer of Souls’ ability will not trigger. In order for the Stealer of Souls ability to trigger it must be in play, so if both the Stealer of Souls</span><span class="style4"> </span><span class="style226"> and the creature it is ﬁghting die, they die simultaneously and the Stealer of Souls ability cannot trigger (see “Destroyed” on Page 10).</span></p><p class="p_style1"><span class="style13">I play the card Library Access (CoTA 115). Is the card immediately put in the discard pile? Or does it remain in play as long as the effect is active.</span></p><p class="p_style1"><span class="style4">Action cards are immediately put into the discard pile after their effects resolve. In the case of an Action card that has a lasting effect like Library Access, once the effect is established by resolving the card, the card is immediately put into the discard pile and does not remain in play.</span></p><p class="p_style1"><span class="style13">I have a Combat Pheromones (CoTA 180), “John Smyth” (CoTA</span><span class="style13"> </span><span class="style302"> 195), and Mindwarper (CoTA 196) in play. I sacriﬁce the Combat</span><span class="style302"> </span><span class="style13"> Pheromones and reap with the Mindwarper, and then reap with “John Smyth” and use “John Smyth’s” reap effect to ready the Mindwarper. Can I use the Mindwarper again?</span></p><p class="p_style1"><span class="style4">Yes, Combat Pheromones is granting permission to use a creature during that turn. If you have an effect that readies one of the Mars cards</span><span class="style4"> </span><span class="style226"> affected by the Combat Pheromones (Such as “John Smyth”), you will be</span><span class="style226"> </span><span class="style4"> able to use that card again.</span></p><p class="p_style1"><span class="style13">I play King of the Crag (CoTA 038) while my opponent has a Looter Goblin (CoTA 041) in play. What happens?</span></p><p class="p_style1"><span class="style4">The rules for damage state that “If a creature has as much or more damage on it as it has power, the creature is destroyed and placed on top of its owner’s discard pile.” When a creature has 0 power, if it has 0 damage on it, it is destroyed.</span></p><p class="p_style1"><span class="style13">My opponent has a Banner of Battle (CoTA 020) in play. Can I play the card Poltergeist (CoTA 069) to destroy the Banner of Battle, even if the artifact can’t be used?</span></p><p class="p_style1"><span class="style4">Yes, you can resolve the effect of Poltergeist on any artifact in play even if the artifact cannot be used. You just resolve as much of the card effect</span><span class="style4"> </span><span class="style226"> as you can (see “Resolve As Much As You Can” on Page 7), and to</span><span class="style226"> </span><span class="style4"> resolve this situation you just destroy the artifact.</span></p><p class="p_style1"><span class="style13">I have no creatures in play and my opponent has two. Can I play the card Lost in the Woods (CoTA 327) even though I don’t have two creatures in play?</span></p><p class="p_style1"><span class="style226">Yes you can. The “Resolve As Much As You Can” rule (see Page 7) says</span><span class="style226"> </span><span class="style4"> that you resolve as much of a card effect as possible and any part of a card you cannot resolve is ignored. In the context of Lost in the Woods,</span><span class="style4"> </span><span class="style226"> it means that you shufﬂe in as many of the creatures as you can. So in</span><span class="style226"> </span><span class="style4"> the case that your opponent has two or more creatures in their battleline</span><span class="style4"> </span><span class="style226"> and you have none, you will shufﬂe in two enemy creatures and no</span><span class="style226"> </span><span class="style4"> friendly creatures.</span></p><p class="p_style1"><span class="style13">I have an exhausted Bumpsy (CoTA 030) in play and my opponent has no creatures in their battleline. I play the card Anger (CoTA 001) and choose to resolve it on Bumpsy. What happens?</span></p><p class="p_style1"><span class="style4">The Bumpsy will be readied by the effect of Anger, but since there are no</span><span class="style4"> </span><span class="style226"> enemy creatures in play it cannot be used to ﬁght so it stays ready. The</span><span class="style226"> </span><span class="style4"> creature can then be used as per the standard rules.</span></p><p class="p_style1"><span class="style302">I control a Spangler Box (CoTA 132) that has purged my own Keliﬁ</span><span class="style302"> </span><span class="style13"> Dragon (CoTA 037). The Spangler Box is returned to its owner’s hand with Grasping Vines (CoTA 324), but I don’t have any Æmber.</span></p><p class="p_style0"><span class="style302">Do I get my Keliﬁ Dragon back?</span></p><p class="p_style0"><span class="style226">Yes. The Keliﬁ Dragon is not being played when it is returned by the</span></p><p class="p_style25"><span class="style4">Spangler Box, it is being put into play. Being put into play bypasses the</span><span class="style4"> </span><span class="style226"> normal play restrictions, meaning that the Keliﬁ Dragon is put back into</span><span class="style226"> </span><span class="style4"> play no matter how much Æmber you have.</span></p><p class="p_style1"><span class="style13">I play Smaaash (CoTA 046), but each of my opponent’s creatures is already stunned. Do I have to resolve the effect against Smaaash itself?</span></p><p class="p_style25"><span class="style4">No. You may still choose to resolve Smaaash’s “</span><span class="style13">Play</span><span class="style4">:” effect against one of your opponent’s creatures, however you cannot put a stun counter on an already stunned creature so nothing will happen.</span></p><p class="p_style1"><span class="style13">My opponent puts two of my creatures into their archives using the card Sample Collection (CoTA 175). On my next turn I play the card Dysania (CoTA 141). What happens?</span></p><p class="p_style1"><span class="style4">Playing the Dysania will cause each of your opponent’s archived cards to be discarded, however since the Sample Collection states that when these creatures leave the archives they are put into their owner’s hand instead these cards are returned to your hand. Since these cards were not discarded by Dysania’s effect, you will not gain any Æmber from the resolution of that effect.</span></p><p class="p_style25"><span class="style13">I have Shadow Self (CoTA 310) with a Raiding Knight (CoTA 255) as a neighbor. My Raiding Knight is then attacked by a 4 power creature. How much damage does each creature take in this situation?</span></p><p class="p_style1"><span class="style4">In this case, the Shadow Self will take 2 damage, the Raiding Knight will take no damage, and the 4 power creature will take 4 damage and be destroyed. This happens because before the damage can be dealt to the Raiding Knight, two of it is prevented by its armor. Then when the damage is actually being dealt, the damage that would be dealt to the Raiding Knight is dealt to the Shadow Self instead. At the same time as the Shadow Self is being dealt damage, the 4 power creature takes 4 damage from the Raiding Knight’s power.</span></p></div></body></html>
